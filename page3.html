        <h4>Reddit relaunched the r/place collaborative project on July 20, 2023, under the tagline "Right Place, Wrong Time", amid several unpopular decisions made by the company which had soured Reddit users, including one that had led to the API controversy which affected Reddit's third-party apps. While announcing the return, Reddit stated: "Hey, what better time to offer a blank canvas to our communities than when our users and mods are at their most passionate… right?"

            <br>
            Within the first day of the 2023 experiment, many writings of "fuck spez" ("spez" being Reddit CEO Steve Huffman's Reddit user name) were placed onto the canvas, some were large-sized, some were small-sized. Another canvas writing, found among art of Germany, stated: "u/spez ist ein Hurensohn". The Messenger website reported that an r/place artwork of "spez" under a guillotine was removed by Reddit; when The Messenger asked Reddit to comment, Reddit stated that it was enforcing its rules (which do not allow targeted hate of individuals). Meanwhile, several other canvas writings simply stated "API". There was also a canvas writing, "never forget what was stolen from us", which endorsed the Save3rdPartyApps community. During canvas expansions, more protests against Huffman appeared, such as the message "spez = twat" done by users making British-themed art.

            In addition to art protesting Reddit, many of the early artworks were flags, plus a multi-colored canvas writing of "DICKS". Among the most notable contributions came from users from the Touhou Project, osu! and Hatsune Miku subreddits, who collaborated to re-animate the shadow-art music video for "Bad Apple!!" on the canvas.The Canadian flag’s maple leaf was also finally drawn properly. Artworks were also created featuring the game Genshin Impact, cats with sunglasses, a Pokémon card of Charizard, and a tribute to the deceased Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade.

            Reddit users collaborating to protest spez (Reddit's CEO) during the final hours of the 2023 experiment due to the 2023 Reddit API controversy.
            The canvas was expanded six times, and the project concluded on July 25, 2023. During the final hours, users were limited to placing greyscale-colored tiles. Users coordinated to spell out "FUCK SPEZ!" in giant white letters in the centre of the board as part of the protest. The entire canvas was eventually filled with white space by the end of the project.</h4>
